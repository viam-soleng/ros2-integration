# Code Deployment

Once viam modules are store in the registry, each version change can deploy not only the code 
changes needed for the module (i.e. components, services, custom interfaces), but we can also
deploy custom code changes, such as:
- webservers & application code
- APK code as needed
- custom binaries such as ROS workspaces, etc.
